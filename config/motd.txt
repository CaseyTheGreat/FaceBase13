This is a <B>light</B> roleplaying server. You are encouraged to have some sort of character but the only real golden rules are <B>NO IC IN OOC</B> and <B>NO OOC IN IC</B>. This basically means do not talk about events in the round in OOC chat, and do not talk about events outside of the round (i.e. server rules or what you had for dinner) in the IC chat.
